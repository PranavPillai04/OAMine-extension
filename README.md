This repo contains code for the paper: [OA-Mine: Open-World Attribute Mining for E-Commerce Products with Weak Supervision](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485447.3512035).

## Introduction
* This project works on *open-world product attribute mining* with weak supervision.
* Unlike previous work that requires attributes of interest to be specified (e.g., "I want to extract brands and colors"), we aim to find *both* new attributes (e.g., "what are possible attributes for TV products") and values (e.g., "4K UHD") from product titles on e-commerce cites.
* Our framework has two steps: [attribute value candidate generation](./candidate_generation) and [attribute value grouping](./value_grouping).
* Please check [here](./data) for dataset release.
